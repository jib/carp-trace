This is the README file for Carp::Trace, a perl module for simple
caller tracing.

Please refer to 'perldoc Carp::Trace' after installation for details.


Carp::Trace follows the standard perl module install process

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install

The module uses no C or XS parts, so no c-compiler is required.
